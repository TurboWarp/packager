            <p>If you're seeing requests to your website with this page in its <code>Referer</code> header, that probably means someone is using a program they created with the <a href="/">TurboWarp Packager</a> to interact with your website.</p>
            <p hidden class="package-name-outer">The creator of the program set their program's package name to "<code class="package-name-value"></code>". They can set this to anything they want, so that may or may not be meaningful.</p>
            <script>
                var packageName = location.hash.substring(1);
                if (packageName) {
                    document.querySelector('.package-name-outer').hidden = false;
                    document.querySelector('.package-name-value').textContent = packageName;
