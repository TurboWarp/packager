# TurboWarp Packager

https://packager.turbowarp.org/

A packager for Scratch projects.

This website is plain HTML and JavaScript, no build steps required. Spin up a local HTTP server and just type and reload. If you don't have one of those on hand, run `node http-server` and open http://localhost:8080/.

It uses a modified version of the TurboWarp GUI, https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/tree/packager
